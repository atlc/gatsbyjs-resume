                            ► <a href="https://github.com/atlc/shitpostify">json-or-cobol-to-md-schema</a>:  This extension allows one to select a body of JSON, our COBOL source code (either a raw file or a linkage library), or just a regular object, and would parse through those bodies, extract the table, and would return a string of Markdown text with a table describing that endpoint/object's schema. This allowed us to paste the Markdown into API documentation instantly, instead of having to write those by hand, saving us an incalculable amount of time for an application with over 300 endpoints, dozens of which that had hundreds of fields. Despite the very niche and almost propriety application of it (though remaining fully open-source), it still manages to maintain over 35 active users on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-or-cobol-to-md-schem/fkenokkcpcdhipimcljpdamfaggbbelh">Chrome Web Store</a>.

Had a feature to randomize the instances of their abbreviations in the titles for maximum chaos. Written with compatibility for both the new reddit redesign and the classic design.

I solved it the way an aspiring developer would solve such an issue - finding a commandline project! The project I found worked great, except for the fact that controls were not iterable, forcing one to call a command many times over if needed. I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/jcarbaugh/python-roku/pull/55/files">pull request</a> to allow certain methods to accept integer parameters of iteration cycles. Though unmerged, it did generate good discussion and the primary developer liked the idea.

                            ► <a href="https://atlc.github.io/dicey-ts-business/build/">Dicey Business (playable demo)</a>: This was a lab of mine for the Covalence bootcamp, with <a href="https://github.com/atlc/dicey-ts-business/">my solution being written in Typescript</a>. A simple OOP exercise for creating a dice generator with fun special click events. I added in a bonus feature to activate a secret 'd20' mode.

A drawing canvas appears; you enter in a shape's dimensions, it validates the dimensions and draws it on the canvas. Single click to get that shape's information in the sidebar, double click to destroy the shape. I also tried out writing with JSDocs for the first time and have the lab <a href="https://github.com/atlc/typescript-up-or-shape-out/tree/master/docs">pretty well-documented here</a>.
